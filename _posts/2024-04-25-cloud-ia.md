title: Building and Deploying a Dockerized User Profile App
---

## Introduction

In today's tech landscape, Docker has become an essential tool for developers, providing a convenient and efficient way to package, distribute, and run applications. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to develop and deploy a simple user profile application using Docker. By containerizing our application components, including the frontend, backend, and database, we'll achieve portability, scalability, and ease of deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Docker and Docker Compose.
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- Familiarity with MongoDB.

## Setting Up with Docker

### Step 1: Create Docker Network

bash docker network create mongo-network

### Step 2: Start MongoDB

bash docker run -d -p 27017:27017
-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin
-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
--name mongodb
--net mongo-network
mongo

### Step 3: Start Mongo Express

bash docker run -d -p 8081:8081
-e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME=admin
-e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD=password
--net mongo-network
--name mongo-express
-e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=mongodb
mongo-express

### Step 4: Open Mongo Express from Browser

Visit [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to access the Mongo Express interface. Here, you can manage your MongoDB databases and collections.

### Step 5: Create User-Account Database

Within Mongo Express, create a new database named "user-account" and a collection named "users".

### Step 6: Start Node.js Application Locally

Navigate to the app directory of your project and start the Node.js server.

bash cd app npm install node server.js

### Step 7: Access the Application UI

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access your Node.js application's user interface.

## Using Docker Compose

### Step 1: Start MongoDB and Mongo Express

bash docker compose up

### Step 2: Create Database and Collection

Access Mongo Express at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and create a new database named "my-db" with a collection named "users".

### Step 3: Start Node Server

Navigate to the app directory, install dependencies, and start the Node.js server.

bash cd app npm install node server.js

### Step 4: Access the Application

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to interact with your Node.js application.

## Building and Deploying the Docker Image

### Step 1: Build Docker Image

bash docker build -t (docker repo name) .

### Step 2: Push to Repository

Before pushing, ensure you're logged into Docker Hub or your preferred registry.

bash docker login docker push <repository_name>

## Conclusion

By Dockerizing our user profile application, we've achieved a modular, scalable, and portable solution that can be easily deployed across different environments. Docker simplifies the development and deployment process, allowing us to focus on building great applications without worrying about infrastructure intricacies. Experiment with Docker and unlock the full potential of containerized applications in your development journey.
